# Oracle_JavaFX

An interface to make the liaison between the Java Code and the Oracle Database !

The Java code has already methods and classes for an old Oracle database (ClubSportif, Dirigeant, Arbitre, etc...)

## BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT :
- You need to add in the classpath : **OJBC14 for JDBC of Oracle 10g**
- You need to add also : **JAVAFX**. I have used the version 21
